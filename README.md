<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  I am Gustave. I am part of the Microverse Program and I did this capstone project according to the required specifications.  

## Getting started
**For this project, I tried our best to recreate the a online shop page. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way using responsive  booststrap as required.**

We built our own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. We carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where some elements of our styling code will reside
